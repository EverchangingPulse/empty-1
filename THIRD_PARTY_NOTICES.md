# Third-Party Notices

This document records third-party material, prior work, and attribution relevant to Raven Studio.

## pyRavenMatrices

**Project:** pyRavenMatrices  
**Author:** Can Mekik  
**Upstream repository:** https://github.com/cmekik/pyRavenMatrices

Early development of Raven Studio inspected pyRavenMatrices and adapted or reimplemented certain geometric ideas and structural approaches from that project.

The original rights in pyRavenMatrices and any upstream material remain with their respective copyright holder(s).

### License status and scope

At the time this notice was prepared, Raven Studio's maintainers had not verified an explicit software license in the upstream pyRavenMatrices repository that would authorize treating upstream material as Apache-2.0.

Accordingly:

1. The Apache License 2.0 included in this repository applies only to material for which the Raven Studio copyright holder(s) have authority to grant that license.
2. The Apache-2.0 license in this repository does **not** purport to relicense pyRavenMatrices or any other third-party material.
3. This repository preserves attribution to Can Mekik and pyRavenMatrices rather than silently presenting upstream work as original Raven Studio material.
4. Anyone intending to redistribute, modify, or otherwise rely on material that is substantially derived from pyRavenMatrices should independently verify the permissions applicable to that upstream material or obtain permission from the relevant rightsholder where necessary.

## Runtime dependencies

The standalone Raven Studio HTML application does not bundle the Python runtime dependencies used by pyRavenMatrices, such as Cairo/Pycairo, merely because the upstream Python project may use them.

Raven Studio renders its interface and generated figures directly in the browser using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG.

## Attribution preservation

Raven Studio's own Apache-2.0-covered material is accompanied by a NOTICE file. Where Apache-2.0 Section 4(d) applies, redistributions of derivative works must preserve the attribution notices contained there in the manner required by the license.

This attribution requirement is separate from, and does not expand, any rights available for third-party material.
